🌍 Triage360: AI-Powered Non-Life-Threatening Emergency Responder  
🎯 **Inspiration**  
The development of Triage360 emerged from a critical experience in our personal lives.
One of my friends fell in a soccer practice and broke his ankle. We didn't know what to do until the next morning and didn't know how long we would have to wait till we got an appointment at our nearest clinic.

🚨 **The Problem**  
The existing process of admitting people in need to an emergency room is not streamlined and takes a lot of time. Also, most people are not aware of what do to in basic healthcare hazards.

💡 **The Solution**  
We envision Triage360, a solution that empowers anyone in need to get basic first-aid/recommended home remedies and connect with the nearest clinics easily; and get any first-aid delivered to your step or get a ride to the chosen clinic.

📚 **What We Learned**  
Through building Triage360, we gained profound insights into both technical innovation and social impact:

🔹 **Tech Takeaways**    
🌐 Streamlit(UI, Maps & AI response)  
🗺️ Google Maps API – Custom markers & real-time  clinic updates  
🔍 Python – To get the web app working end-to-end  
⚡ Gemini API – Built AI response for first-aid response  

🔧 **DevOps & Deployment**  
🔐 Secure API Keys – Environment variables with .env  
🛠️ GitHub for Version Control – Collaboration & feature branching  
📡 Postman API Testing – Debugging & endpoint validation  

🔹 **User-Centered Design**  
Balanced functionality and user privacy, ensuring sensitive health-related data is managed with care.
Created an inclusive and easy-to-use interface for all users.

🛠️ **How We Built It**  
Triage360 was developed using minimalistic AI chat response that ensures real-time functionality and a smooth user experience.

🚧 **Challenges We Faced**  
Building Triage360 wasn’t easy! We tackled several technical and ethical challenges:

❌ Real-time Data Management  
✔️ It was difficult to find a dataset which correctly fits our use case, so we fabricated a few data points.  

❌ Privacy Concerns  
✔️ Ensured anonymous updates and made only relevant data publicly visible.  

❌ User Interface Balance  
✔️ Designed an interface that is both informative and intuitive– giving users centralized information and keeping them informed.  

❌ Multi-Tech Integration  
✔️ Coordinated mapping, real-time delivery system, and AI response functionality seamlessly.  

🌟 **Impact & Future Directions**  
Triage360 has evolved into a comprehensive platform that combines resource accessibility with health education.

🎯 **How does Triage360 help?**  
✅ Provides real-time steps to handle a medical situation.  
✅ Empower users to get help in real time and not wait for it.  
✅ AI Chatbot assists with menstrual health concerns.  

📈 **What's next for Triage360?**
📷 Add interaction functionality for everyone(hard of hearing/heard of sight)
